MultiTHUMOS extends the THUMOS '14 action detection dataset with dense, multilabel annotations. Videos in the THUMOS '14 action detection "Validation Data" and "Test Data" sets are annotated.

Annotations are provided in the same format as THUMOS. For each action class, a text file is provided with one temporal instance per line, in the format [video_name start_time end_time]. The times are in seconds with 1 decimal point precision.

The file class_list.txt lists the 65 classes in the dataset. The first 20 classes are the THUMOS '14 action detection classes (annotation files are provided for convenience), and the remaining 45 classes are the new MultiTHUMOS classes. Following, textual elaboration of some classes are also provided.
